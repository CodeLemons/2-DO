### Todo

- [ ] Add some form of animations to different areas of the app ( maybe add animation for buttons and/or sounds on button press... maybe vibration on button press)
= [ ] Add a feature where if a list item is swiped to the left a red button appears that can be pressed to delete an item/ or just swipe left to delete item entirely.
= [ ] Replace local array that stores the data with a working database.
- [ ] Add a working login screen that has google/facebook/"apple ?" authentication
- [ ] Make the category section in the modal screen assign that said category to the item in the list under a field called "category" in the (local array/database)

### In progress 
- [ ] Complete modal screen ( with working submit forms and fixed modal submit button)
## What's going on on the current task in progress?
= [ ] Need to find a way to pass the addTask function as a prop to the modal component, without messing up the flex box layout.
- [x] The modal access button -> shadows do not work on the vector icon used for the button... Needs fixing.
- [x] Deleted second text input that was deemed unecessary after some more thinking.

- [x] Refactor StyleSheet names on all files for easier code readability
