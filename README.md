## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Any prerequisites, libraries, etc., are found inside the node_modules folder of the project.
* The program runs on Android, because react native wrties native code for both anroid and ios, that means it should wokr for IOS as well, even though it was not tested.
* You will need the latest version of Node.js and Expo CLI, you can follow the instalation process for both in the following links: 
- https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/
- https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/

### Installing

* Clone this repository into a folder

### Executing program

* Inside the repository folder run
```
npm install
```
* After npm installs all the libraries necessary for the program to run, execute
```
expo start
```
* After expo runs, you can either install the ExpoGo App on your phone and scan the QR code that appears or run a Virtual Device Manager from Android Studio to simulate a mobile phone device on your desktop.

* If you choose the Android Studio Simulator, after following the instalation process and setting it up, inside the terminal that has Expo running press 'a'. That will trigger the app to open on the simulator.
